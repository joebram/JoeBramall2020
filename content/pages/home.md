I'm currently working at FutureGov, designing services fit for the 21st century. I'm also a co-founder of NUX Liverpool and GovJam Liverpool, I volunteer my skills at various UX and service design events around the UK.

Skills include: Service design, information architecture, user research, ideation, visual design, prototyping and usability testing.

I use a broad range of tools and processes to make sure my work always meets user's needs.
